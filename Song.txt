In a way it's a, a matter of time
I will not worry for you, You'll be just fine
Take my thoughts with you, and when you look behind
You will surely see a face that you recognize
You're not alone I'll wait till the end of time
Open your mind, Surely it's plain to see
You're not alone, I'll wait till the end of time for you
Open your mind, Surely it's time to be with me
It is the distance
That makes life a little hard
Two minds that once were close



See how our love has grown
You're not alone, I'll wait till the end of time
Open your mind, Surely its plane to see
You're not alone, I'll wait 'till the end of time
Open your mind, baby there's time for me and you
You're not alone, I'll wait till the end of time
Open your mind, Surely its plane to see
You're not alone
